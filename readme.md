Coding mods yourself is hard, so why not make one with some help from the community?  
We will be accepting every pull request to this repo, within reason.  
Each push to this repo will cause a new mod version to be uploaded to our Maven and to CurseForge.  

We have some standards for contributions.

- You must own the textures and code you contribute.
- You must keep all changes restrained to a package named with your username.
- You must test your additions - broken code will be removed and you'll have to PR it again

Keep your common sense, don't break any Terms of Service or the Minecraft EULA.  
Other than that, all the information you need is in the main MMDCommunity class.
